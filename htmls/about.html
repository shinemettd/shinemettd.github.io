        <h2 class="specify-text delete-top-margin"> About: </h2>
        <p class="specify-text"> As I said before, my name is David, I am 19 years old, I live in Kyrgyzstan, Bishkek and I am currently studying at Ala-Too International University. 
            Previously, I studied for 11 years in school-gymnasium number 6, was a good (maybe even talented) student, graduated with relative honors, passed the state testing (ORT) with 210 points and received a good discount for studying at the university. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="specify-text delete-top-margin"> Brief story: </h2>
        <p class="specify-text">Since childhood I was interested in computers and everything related to them, first it was games and then programming. Fortunately, thanks to my childhood affection for computers, almost any computer logic and code is clear to me. Even though I'm not a big fan of front-end because I haven't had much experience with it, in a short time I kind of got used to it a bit.</p>    
        <h2 class="specify-text delete-top-margin"> Hobbies: </h2>
        <p class="specify-text"> Also my hobbies are reading and active translation of works from English into Russian. Frequent hobby of various online games, as well as music, I just unrealistically like to listen to music in the off.</p>  
        <h2 class="specify-text delete-top-margin"> Skills: </h2>
        <p class="specify-text"> From my skills, I can emphasize a good understanding of Java programming language, maybe a little Python and C++. Also good at online games :))) And I'm even better at helping other people, because I don't know how to refuse (for now). </p>
