            &nbsp;<br>This project was developed both in teamwork (in JavaFX) and alone in Java Swing. <br>It took about 7 days to test bugs and various user usage scenarios.
            &nbsp;<br>The calculator can take an infinite number of operands and operators and is not bound to a single two-variable operand.

    <p class="specify-works-text delete-works-top-margin">The second project is a new text editor with similar functionality to Microsoft's text editor, but with advanced features such as: ToolBar, ability to change text color, print with colored text, dark theme and other useful features.
        &nbsp;<br>This was our team project, and I was responsible for customizing the user interface as well as the functionality of the "File" tab.

    <p class="specify-works-text delete-works-top-margin">The last Java Basic project in my internship is a yet-to-be-started Sokoban game, which I've already done as an alpha version, with a working model and game logic.
        &nbsp;<br>The peculiarity of this project is that the test of our code will use a multithreaded environment, so it is on this project that the next internship participants who were able to resolve the optimization opportunity will be determined.
        &nbsp;<br>Unfortunately, since the project hasn't been officially started yet, there's no page on GitHub yet, but you can always track its arrival on my <a href="https://github.com/shinemettd/">GitHub profile</a>.
